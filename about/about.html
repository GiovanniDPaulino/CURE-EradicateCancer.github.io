        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Our mission:</h1>
        <div class="statement">
        <p style="text-align: center;">Eradicate Cancer will supercharge cancer research (and potentially all of healthcare) 
            by cutting paperwork time. Powerful automation features will ensure that front line 
            workers are not wasted as pen pushers.  On the supporter side of the application, 
            actual researchers will be able to post requests for donations, and donors will see
            exactly what their contributions do.  Every function of Eradicate Cancer will be 
            efficient, with design that optimizes down to the second.  Alternate donations will 
            include a statistician forum to prevent deceptive public relation narratives, a 
            volunteer legal team to protect research funds from being siphoned by insurance firms, 
            and the aforementioned donation of computing power.  The core objective of this project 
            is to save lives by increasing the efficiency of documentation and funding in healthcare</p>
